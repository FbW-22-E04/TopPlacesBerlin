#Forking

Forking is really fun.
You can do it anywhere with anyone in the world and you can both fork all you want.
Do not forget to pull though after you are done forking.
In order to do that you need to ask for a pull request, and if the request was accepted then forking was finished successfully.
Forking, cloning, pulling, and pushing ... fun stuff! 
Enjoy!
